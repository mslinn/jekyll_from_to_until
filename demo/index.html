<p>
  The examples on this web page use a variable called <code>lines</code>,
  which is a multiline string.
  <code>lines</code> is defined as:
</p>
<pre>{% raw %}{% capture lines %}line 1
line 2
line 3
line 4
line 5
{% endcapture %}{% endraw %}</pre>
{% capture lines %}line 1
line 2
line 3
line 4
line 5
{% endcapture %}


<h2 id="from">From</h2>
<p>
  This example returns the lines from the first line containing the string <code>3</code>
  is found, until the last line in the multiline string.
</p>
<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | from: 3 }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | from: 3 }}</pre>


<h2 id="to">To (Inclusive Match)</h2>
<p>
  This example returns the lines of the file from the first line until a line with the string <code>3</code>
  is found, <b>including</b> the matched line in the multiline string.
</p>
<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | to: 3 }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | to: 3 }}</pre>


<h2 id="until">Until (Exclusive Match)</h2>
<p>
  This example returns the lines of the file from the first line until a line with the string <code>3</code>
  is found, <b>not including</b> the matched line in the multiline string.
</p>
<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | until: 3 }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | until: 3 }}</pre>


<h2 id="id2_4in">Between the lines containing "2" and "4", Inclusive</h2>
<p>
  This example returns the lines that start from the first line containing <code>2</code>
  until a line with the string <code>4</code>
  is found, <b>including</b> the last matched line in the multiline string.
</p>

<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | from: 2 | to: 4 }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | from: 2 | to: 4 }}</pre>


<h2 id="id2_4ex">Between the lines containing "2" and "4", Exclusive</h2>
<p>
  This example returns the lines that start from the first line containing <code>2</code>
  until a line with the string <code>4</code>
  is found, <b>not including</b> the last matched line in the multiline string.
</p>

<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | from: 2 | until: 4 }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | from: 2 | until: 4 }}</pre>


<h2 id="regex">Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>
  The <code>from</code>, <code>to</code> and <code>until</code> filters can accept regular expressions.
</p>
<p>
  This regular expression matches lines that have either the string <code>line 2</code> or
  <code>line 3</code> at the beginning of the line.
  This example returns the contents of the multiline string from the matched line until the end of the string.
</p>
<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | from: '^line (2|3)' }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | from: '^line (2|3)' }}</pre>

<p style="margin-top: 0.75in">
  The first regular expression in this example matches lines that have either the string <code>line 2</code> or
  <code>line 3</code> at the beginning of the line.
  The second regular expression in this example matches lines that have either the string <code>line 4</code> or
  <code>line 5</code> at the beginning of the line.
  This example returns the contents of the multiline string from the first matched line until the
  second matched line, or end of the multiline string.
</p>
<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | from: '^line (2|3)'  | to: '^line (4|5)' }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | from: '^line (2|3)'  | to: '^line (4|5)' }}</pre>

<p style="margin-top: 0.75in">
  This example is similar to the preceding example, except that the last matching line is not returned.
</p>
<pre>{% raw %}{{ lines | from: '(2|3)'  | until: '(4|5)' }}{% endraw %}</pre>
<p>Renders as:</p>
<pre>{{ lines | from: '(2|3)'  | until: '(4|5)' }}</pre>
